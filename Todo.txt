1- Environment Variables to call apis instead of direct calls in each request on main branch

2- Automated Testing i.e e2e & unit tests on main branch 

Key-Points/Summary/Troubleshooting: 

    $ Api data not showing up or showing up in console but not in UI 
    
        1- In order to change global state & present/re-render data, the initial state variable or data along with new data that will replace mock or initial data/state should both be exported from provider & imported in the component where they are meant to be displayed
        
    $ Rendered object from headless wordpress is not being defined/displayed , try to render before displaying it like so..
        
        1- In global state where data is being received , if all data is not to be rendered then separate both
        2- In global state fetch function but while passing it as a payload
        3- In reducer try to render it 
        4- In presentation component while importing the fetch funcion or displaying it...
